<h2>THE HUMOUR OF GOLF</h2>

<p>There are few pastimes that supply their followers with more
innocent merriment than is afforded by "the royal and ancient."
Certainly no outdoor game can make the neophyte feel more
utterly worm-like in his ability, for it is the peculiar quality of
golf to appear to be absurdly easy to the onlooker and preposterously
difficult to the unpractised player. It may be taken
that there is no better way of reducing a man's self-conceit than
to place him on the teeing ground for the first time, present him
with a driver and invite him to strike a little rubber-cored ball
to a distance of 200 yards in a given direction. Consequently we
have here most excellent material for fun; and you may depend
upon it <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has not had his eyes long shut to the
humours of the links. Despite the royalty and antiquity of
golf, it has been thoroughly democratised in modern times, and
its popularity, in the wide proportions to which it has attained,
is chiefly a matter of recent years. Despite the shortness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the period that is represented by what we may call the vogue
of golf&mdash;a vogue that is by no means in danger of passing&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr.
Punch</span> has evidently found the game so rich in fun that
his merry knights of the pen and the pencil have contributed to
his pages as many pictures as to illustrate very lavishly this
volume and a good deal more literary matter than could be
used. In the days when croquet was as popular as golf is
to-day&mdash;the days of Leech and Keene&mdash;doubtless a volume could
have been drawn from <span class="smcap">Punch</span> devoted entirely to that sport.
But it is worthy of note that an examination of these old croquet
pictures and jokes for a comparison of them with the contents
of the present volume leaves one with the conviction that the
humour of the present day is infinitely superior to the humour
of the days of Leech and Keene. Admirable draughtsmen
though these artists were, both of them, but Leech particularly,
were often content to let their masterly drawings appear with
the feeblest jokes attached. The standard of humour has been
immensely raised of late years, and <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's Golf
Stories</span> is no bad evidence of that.</p>

<p>Golfers I divides in me own mind into three clarses; them as 'its the
ball, them as skratches it, and them as neither 'its nor skratches the
blooming ball but turns rarnd and wants to 'it or skratch anyone as is
small and 'andy. The first clars is very rare, the second is dreadfull
plentifull, and the third, thank 'evins, can jeneraly be kep clear of by
them as knows the ropes. Sich as meself.</p>

<p>Any himprovement in golfers, as a clars, is doo to the 'uge morril
hinfluence of us caddies, 'oom <span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> some pretends to look down on.
Much can be done, even wif the most 'ardened (and some of them golfers
is dreadfull 'ardened), by firmness and hexample. "Show 'em from the
fust as you'll stand no nonsense," is allus my words when the yunger
caddies gathers ararn me fer hadvice. Me being older than me years, as
the sying is, and much looked up to. If, as I often 'ears say, there's
less of langwidge and more of golf upon these 'ere links, it's doo in no
small part to 'im 'oo pens these lines. 'Oo's 'onnered nime is 'Enery
Wilks.</p>

<p>I seldom demmeans meself to speak to the kulprits, for severil reasons
which I shall not go into, but I 'ave other meffods. There's sniffing,
fer instance. Much can be done by jerdishous sniffing, which can be
chinged to soot all cases. Or there's a short, 'ard, dryish larf, but
that ain't allus sife. As a blooming rule, I rellies upon me sniff, me
smile and me eye. There's few of them as can meet the last when I chuses
to turn it on. Not as I objecs very strongly to a little 'onnest
cussing; it's hinjustice and false haccusashun as I will not stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Sich are me meffods to them as needs 'em, but don't think, becos at
times I'm cold like and 'ard and stern, that I cannot be jentle wif them
as call fer jentleness. No blooming errer! 'Enery Wilks is the lad to
'oom old gents in need of keerfull nussing should be hintrusted by their
wives and keepers. I'm not allooding now to old tigers 'oos stiple food
is red pepper in 'uge quantitties, 'oo turn upon yer like blooming
manniacks if yer blows yer nose quite inercent, and 'oo report yer
before yer know if you're standing on yer 'ead or yer 'eels. No, I'm not
allooding to old gentlemen like them! 'Enery Wilks 'as very little use
fer sich unguvverned creetures. In 'is erpinyun they should not be let
abrord without a chine. But I am allooding to them 'oos pashuns age 'as
tamed, insted of blooming well hincreesed, to jentle 'armless old
fellers, 'oo will almost eat out of yer 'and, as the sying is, an sich a
one is Mister Perceval Giggington.</p>

<p>Over sixty 'e is, and allus kind and civvil and respeckfull, but 'e 'as
no more haptitood fer golf than a jeerarf. Sometimes I thinks, musing
kindly like, as 'ow the old cove 'ud be yunger if 'e took the gime less
seerius. But 'Enery Wilks 'as little to reproche 'imself about; 'e, at
least, 'as done what 'e could to 'elp old Giggs. 'Is wife came down to
the Club 'Ouse wif 'im larst Toosday, jest as nice an old lidy as 'e's a
gent. She drew me on one side and spoke konfidenshul like, while the old
man was fussing and bleeting about 'is clubs. It seems as she'd 'eard of
me, and 'eard nuthing but good. Which is only right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Enery," she ses, "me 'usband 'as set 'is 'art,
as you well know, on going rarnd the course in
under an 'undred and thirty strokes. It's
beginning to tell on 'is 'ealth, the strine and
diserpointment, and I wants it stopped. 'E's
going rarnd allone wif you now, as the course is
clear, and I wants," she ses, "<i>I wants you to see
as 'e does it!</i>" she ses.</p>

<p>Well, nobody, excep one ignerrant, gellous,
preggerdiced skoolmaster, 'as ever dared to call
'Enery Wilks a fool. I took 'er meaning in a
moment, and I touched me cap, quiet and konfident
like. "Mike yer mind easy, mum," I ses in
my korteous way. "It shall be done, this very
day, if 'Enery Wilks is spared," I ses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>She nods and smiles and slips a bob into me
'and, and then old Giggs finishes wurrying abart
'is clubs and we makes a start. The old 'un
'ands 'is card to me to keep, and I speaks to 'im,
kind like but firm.</p>

<p>"I'll keep the score, sir," I ses. "Don't yer
wurry abart yer strokes at all. What you've got
to do is to koncentrite yer mind upon yer gime.
For we're a-goin to do it to-day," I ses. 'E 'ears
me wif a little sorrerful smile, and I lived up to
them remarks. 'E'd arsk me at the end of an 'ole,
that 'e'd fairly bitten along, 'ow many 'e'd taken,
but I would never tell 'im. I jest kep 'im upon
'is legs wif kindly, jerdishous praise. Even after
that 'ole where 'e'd strook me wif 'is ball from the
drive, although standing well be'ind 'im, and been
in each bunker twice or more, I give 'im a word
of 'ope. It was niblick play and 'ope all rarnd
the blooming course. And at the end, when I
added up 'is card, strike me pink if 'is score
weren't an 'undred and twenty-nine! And I sent
'im 'ome to 'is wife, as pleased as any child.
There's some, I dessay, as would 'ave made 'is
score an 'undred and nineteen or even less, but
'Enery Wilks 'as allus known the virtew of
modderation.<br />

<p>There's some as takes their golf too seerius fer
their strength, like that pore old Mister Giggington,
of 'oom I've told yer, and there's some as
don't take it seerius enuff. Under this 'eading I
places Mister 'Erminius Brellett. 'E's what
they call a litterry cove in privit life, and, wifout
wishing to be undoolly 'arsh, I must say as I
beleeves it of 'im. Strike me pink, if I didn't
know as 'e was litterry, I should go away sometimes
after 'earing 'im talk, and swear a hinfer-mashun
of loonacy agin 'im! But Chawley
Martin, one of our caddies, 'oo once spoke quite
hintermate and friendly like wif a reporter feller,
in connecshun wif a biking accerdent caused by
Chawley's unforchernate pashun fer trick riding,
ses as 'ow all these pore riters is alike. So you
and me should only pitty them. As fer 'is golf,
exsentrick ain't the word fer it. 'E stands wif
both 'is feet quite klose together, springs 'igh into
the air wif a tremenjus swing, and strikes the ball
afore 'e comes to earth agin. The erstonishing
thing is that 'e does strike it abart once in three,
and when 'e does it goes like old Gewillikins. It
just shows as there ain't no rules abart some
peeple's golf. But the sad part is as 'e's quite
proud of 'is stile, insted of laberring to kerrect it
under my tewishun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<p>"I'm a mishonnery, a pyoneer of golf, 'Enery,"
'e ses to me quite recent. "'Ow I plays it to-day,
the rest of the silly 'ide-bound creetures will play
it to-morrow," 'e ses.</p>

<p>"Let's 'ope not, sir," I ses, quite respeckfull
and reely meaning the words; fer, if yer think of
it, a course full of Mister 'Erminius Brelletts
would be an 'iddeous sight. 'E glared at me fer a
moment quite dangerous, and then 'e began to
larf. What wif 'is livver, at which 'e's allus
cussing, and 'is kurious 'arf-irriterble, 'arf-manniackal
temper, I can tell yer 'e takes some 'andling.
But 'Enery Wilks knows 'is 'Erminius Brellett
by this time.</p>

<p>"Your one chawnce of fime, you retched child,"
'e ses, and I found 'is stile of speaking jest a little
gorling, "will rest on the fact that you karried the
clubs of 'Erminius Brellett, pyoneer of golf and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
unerpreshiated riter of himmortal books," 'e ses.
Well, yer can't argue wif a man like that. Yer
can only yumour 'im by respeckful silence, and
be reddy all the time to dodge if 'is manyer turns
'ommersidal all of a sudden.</p>

<p>'E took on Mister Washer the other day, a
member 'oom both 'e and I 'ave little liking fer.
At least, I can arnser fer meself. Fer 'e's one of
your pompus, strutting sort of fellers, 'oo thinks
'e's good at golf, but ain't. I 'eard 'im chalenge
Mister Brellett to play a rarnd fer 'arf-a-crown,
and a less skilful stoodent of yuman nachure than
'Enery Wilks could 'ave told as they didn't love
each other. I 'ad a privit tuppence on the match
meself, wif old Washer's caddy, although not very
'opeful. 'Owever, when 'Enery Wilks' money is
down, as the sying is, 'e's 'ard to beat.</p>

<p>But things went badly wif us from the start. I
could see as 'ow Mister Brellett was wurried abart
somethink, and in addition to that 'e was acktaly
trying to play a keerful, sientifick gime. Oh, lumme,
it was orful, I can tell yer! We was skarcely
touching a ball, and old Washer, as pleesed as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a turkey-kock but far less hornimental, was
playing right above 'isself. Fer a man like
meself, 'oo'd staked above 'is means, it was 'art-breaking.
We lost five 'oles bang orf, and then
Mister Brellett spoke 'arf to me and 'arf to 'isself
as we walked to the sixth tee.</p>

<p>"It's all that cussed nime!" 'e ses. "If I
could only think of that, I'd be orlright. A
female nime fer a kerrecter in my new book.
'Enery, what's the nime of your yung woman?"
'e ses, joking like. Well, love ain't much in my
line, me ambishuns not letting me 'amper meself
wif wimmen, but still a feller 'as to keep 'is 'and
in. I won't say as I 'aven't been more run after
than most, but some'ow that ain't one of my
temptashuns. 'Owever, more to pleese 'er than
meself, I lets one of them, jest a school kiddy,
walk out wif me at times. She means well, I
do believe, but I've allus reckoned as 'ow 'er
nime's agin 'er.</p>

<p>"Hervangeline's 'er nime, Mister Brellett," I
ses, deprerkating like. "But she can't 'elp it,"
I ses.</p>

<p>"By Jewpiter!" 'e 'owls. "Hervangeline's the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
very nime I've been 'unting for. And now I'll
win this match!" 'e ses.</p>

<p>"You'll win it orlright, sir," I ses, ernest like.
"But, for 'evin's sake, stop playing sientifick!
Play the old gime as you're pyoneer on, sir,"
I ses.</p>

<p>"I beleeve as 'ow you're right, 'Enery," 'e ses,
thoughtful like; and then we come to the tee and
watched old Washer drive 'is yusual straight,
shortish ball. Then Mister Brellett grips 'is club,
takes 'is yusual wicked, himmoril stance, springs
'igh into the air wif an 'arf-styfled yell, and, by
Gewillikins, drives sich a ball as the pro. 'isself
might 'ave been proud on! It knocked the kowardly
'art out of old Washer, did that tremenjus
drive; and 'e's a man as only plays 'is best
when 'e's winning easy. They 'ad a narsty lead,
but we stuck to 'em like wax, 'itting a turriffick
ball once out of three, or even oftener, and we won
at last quite 'andsomely by three and two.</p>

<p>I remember as I bought bull's-eyes fer Hervangeline
wif that 'ere tuppence, becos in a meshure,
as you may say, she'd 'ad an 'and in the winning of
it. 'Owever, wif a jenerosity unyusual in wimmen,
she hinsisted on sharing 'em wif 'Enery Wilks,
'oos skilful leedership 'ad reely won the match.

<p>Taking it all in all, 'Enery Wilks 'as very
little use for wimmen. Excep, of course, as
playthings and rellaxashuns after toil. As sich I
regards Hervangerline, of 'oom I've told yer.
That is, when 'er mood is dosile. At sich times,
when she is not trying to be yumourous or utherwise
acting the goat, the child can listen, wif
doo respekt, whilst 'im she loves so well unbends
'isself. It is 'er privviledge to see 'Enery Wilks
remove 'is stern cold marsk. Yuss, I tollerates
Hervangerline, but I 'ave little use fer uther
wimmen.</p>

<p>Speaking quite frenkly, I can find little to
kommend in the hexeckertive of these 'ere links,
but there is one of their resent hinnervashuns in
pertickler that fills me wif cold rage. This is the
rule permitting lidy members to play on the course,
excep' on Satterday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Lord knows as 'ow the men is bad enuff to deal
wif. 'Eadstrong, vain, irriterble and pig-'eaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
they mostly is, but oh! strike me pink and
purple, if they ain't fair angels, wings and all,
kompared to those dredfull, onreasoningable
wimmen! Onreasoningable is the one word as
I can use to deskribe them. And that don't do
'em justise.</p>

<p>Wif a man, to some eggstent, you do know
where you are. You do know from eggsperiense
'ow fur you may go wif 'im, before 'e katches you
a clump on the side of the 'ead. But wif wimmen
no eggsperiense will 'elp yer. Becos there ain't
no rules abart them.</p>

<p>Lord knows as 'ow I started out wif the idear
of pleesing 'em. I ses to Hervangerline, the
evening I 'eard abart it, "We're going to 'ave
lidies on the course, kid," I ses. "Your 'Enery
will 'ave to smarten 'isself up a bit fer their dear
sakes," I ses. Womanlike she begun to snif.</p>

<p>"You take care, 'Enery Wilks," she ses
worningly. "You take care of them desining
'ussies. There's many of 'em as will be after you,
I knows it well. Fer some wimmen," she ses, sort
of sarkastic, "some wimmen will go after anythink
in trarsers," she ses. Well, I wears nickers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34a" id="Page_34a">[Pg 34]</a></span>
meself as a general rule, but I knowed what she
meant. And, though of course I 'id it from her,
pertending to be kontemptewous, I found 'er
words quite pleesing. I thort to meself, komplasent
like, as 'ow some of these lidy members
might show a prefferrence fer that one of our
caddies as is pollished and korteous and older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35a" id="Page_35a">[Pg 35]</a></span>
than 'is years. But, apparriently, both I and
Hervangerline was rong&mdash;iddeously rong.</p>

<p>Fer it's no good konseeling from meself, at
anyrate, as 'ow I 'aven't been a komplete success
so fur wif our lidy members. Why sich should
be the case I cannot tell, but there it is. There's
a preggerdise agin me as is kep' alive by the
ontiring, revengfull tungs of Miss Trigsie Kornish
and Missis Jossephus 'Askins. And this is 'ow
that preggerdise begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36a" id="Page_36a">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>They come along one morning and say as
'ow they're going to play a rarnd, and they'll
share a caddy between them. And to my ondying
greef they picked on 'Enery Wilks. Not as
there was anythink surprising in their doing that.
In their place I'd 'ave picked on 'im meself.
And I'm bound in justise to say as there was
nothing in <i>their</i> appeerance to set me agin them.
Missis 'Askins is very yung and plessant-looking,
although she <i>is</i> married, and Miss Kornish is
darkish and carries 'erself wif a sort of swing.
No, their looks was rite enuff; it was only their
dredfull 'abit of cheating as made the trubble.</p>

<p>They started as frendly as love-birds, but by
the second 'ole the fur was beginning to stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
up stiff upon their backs. It was their orful
onguvernabul keenness as did it. On the third
green Missis 'Askins asks Miss Kornish 'ow many
she's played, and she tells 'er, nine, quite brisk
like. Now both Misses 'Askins and meself <i>knew</i>
quite well as 'ow Miss Kornish 'ad played ten;
indeed, I could see as ow Misses 'Askins thort it
were eleven. They rangles a bit abart it, growing
gradewally more 'eated, and then Misses 'Askins
erpeals to me, and I gives it in 'er favour, trying
very 'ard to rap it up plessant like. Miss Kornish
glares at me like a cat 'oom you've mannidged to
'it wif a brick whilst it's taking a stroll quite
inercent and leshurely; but she doesn't say much
and we goes on.</p>

<p>Two 'oles later it all 'appens agin, only this
time it's Missis 'Askins 'oo 'as kondescended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
redooce 'er score. They rages rarnd upon the
green, and then Miss Kornish erpeals to me,
and truth kompels me to erward the 'ole to 'er.
This time it's Missis 'Askins 'oo glarnces at me
as though she'd like to cut orf my yung life. But
'Enery Wilks can stand a lot of that.</p>

<p>So we goes on agin, wif the air growing 'eavier
like, and three 'oles later they both erpeals to me,
fer both is cheating. It was an 'ard posishun fer
a yung feller as is only wishfull to pleese. 'Owever,
I desided to give pore old Truth another chawnce;
although misdoubtfull. So I ses to them quite
respeckfull like, as 'ow both their scores is
inakkerite and should I keep them both in
fuchure?</p>

<p>Oh Lumme, I'd like to forgit what 'appened
then! All in a moment those two young wimmen
grew frendly agin to each other and konsentrited
all their rage and spite on 'Enery Wilks. They
fell upon me wif their tungs, and I felt as though
I was being 'it wif barbed wire and nettels. They
called me "impudent little boy," me the chosin
'ero of the yunger caddies, and I could only
garsp and trimble. Their crewel thretts brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40a" id="Page_40a">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tears even to my proud eyes, and I almost beleeve
as 'ow I grovvellel before them. It 'urts me to
remember it.</p>

<p>When at last they 'ad tired themselves out, they
finished their rarnd as though they 'ad never 'ad
an unkind thort towards each other, and I slunk
be'ind them, dased and silent, like a puppy 'oos
been kicked.</p>

<p>And that's&mdash;that's what comes of edmitting
wimmen to a golf corse!

<p>Yumin nachure is a kurius thing. I dunno

<p>Sich an eggspeerience must leeve its mark upon
any man, 'owever strong. It 'as left its mark
upon Mister Hoctavius Glenwistle. Every blade
of 'air 'as vannished from 'is skalp, and 'is face is
a sort of dark brick colour wif light eyebrows. 'E
still suffers from sunstroke, and Chawley Martin
'as to carry a large red umbereller round the links
to pertect 'is 'ead.</p>

<p>I dunno whether it's the sunstroke, or whether
it's 'is ondying remorce for that pore faithfull
poodle, but Mister Glenwistle suffers terrible from
absentmindedness. 'E 'as been known to swing
up 'is great, red umbereller upon the tee and try
to drive wif that, and Chawley Martin allus 'as to
watch 'im keerfull to see what 'e'll be up to next.
'E 'ates to be disturbed when in one of 'is mooning
fits, and is apt to swear terrible in some forrin'
langwidge, which Chawley thinks is Eskimo; but
still 'e's a jentleman all over, is Mister Hoctavius
Glenwistle. 'Is tips is 'andsome, and it don't give
'im no pleshure to repport an 'armless lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>One Sunday lately 'e came down wif a frend for
an 'ole day's golf. Chawley Martin, as yusual,
was 'is caddie, and I ondertook the manidgement
of the frend. All went well in the morning, excep'
that Mister Glenwistle fell into a sort of dream
upon the seventh green and 'ad to be rarsed by
Chawley. It may 'ave been Eskimo that 'e spoke
to the boy when 'e'd touched 'im jently on the
arm, but it sounded wuss&mdash;much wuss.</p>

<p>'Owever, we comes back at one to the club-'ouse,
red umbereller and all, like <i>Robbinson Crewso</i>,
and they goes into lunch. Whilst they're still
laying into the grub like winking, I and Chawley
Martin, 'aving eaten our own frugil meal, sit down
near the 'club-'ouse and begin to polish up their
clubs. We fell a-talking about the great science
of golf, getting quite 'eated in a little while, and
at last Chawley, to illerstrate 'is own mistakin
theery, gets upon 'is 'ind legs. 'E takes Mister
Glenwistle's best driver from 'is bag and shows
me what 'e calls "a full swing, wif every
ounce of weight and rist and mussel crammed
into it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>


<p>I was afeard 'ow it would be. The length of the
club mastered 'im. 'E 'it the onoffending turf a
crewel blow, and there was a narsty crack. 'E
sits down beside me wif a garsp, and we looks at
Mister Glenwistle's pet driver wif the 'ead 'arf off.</p>

<p>"What's to be done, 'Enery?" 'e ses, after a
sort of sickly pawse.</p>

<p>Fer my part I'd been thinking 'ard, me brain
being better than most.</p>

<p>"There's three courses open to you, Chawley,
me lad," I ses quietly. "You can do a guy at
once, and not come back&mdash;that's one; or you can
tell Mister G. as you've been fooling wif 'is clubs&mdash;that's
another," I ses, and waited fer 'is
risponse.</p>

<p>"Let's 'ear the third," he ses gloomily.</p>

<p>"Deceat is aborrent to my nachure," I ses.
"But you're made diferent, Chawley. You
could make use of 'is absentmindedness and let
'im think as 'e broke it 'isself. 'Old it out to
'im wif a sort of winning smile, when 'e comes,
and say as 'ow you're afrade it will 'ave to be
mended after all. It's a fair sportin' chawnce,"
I ses.</p>

<p>"'Enery, you're a fair marvel!" 'e ses, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pondering fer a minute. "I'll try it on," he ses.
And so we left it.</p>

<p>I didn't see the meeting between Mister Glenwistle
and 'is well-meaning caddie, becos my klient
sent me to get him a ball, but when I came back
I seed as 'ow Chawley was sniffing slightly, and 'is
large outstanding ears was reddened. 'Is manner
was coldish like to me, but when the two 'ad
drivin, I asked 'im what 'ad 'appened.</p>

<p>"'E just boxed me ears," Chawley ses, "and
told me as 'ow 'e'd repport me if I lied to 'im
agen," 'e ses.</p>

<p>Fer once I was reely taken aback.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out, Chawley," I ses. "Where
was 'is yusual absentmindedness? It just shows
as 'ow you can't depend on nuthing in this world!
Did you do as I told you, winning smile and all?"
I asks 'im.</p>

<p>"Yuss, I did," 'e ses, snappish like. "But it
seems as 'ow 'is interfeering frend 'appened to look
out of the club-'ouse when I was showing you
that swing, and seed it all. Anuther time you
can keep your winning smiles and your fat-'eaded
hadvice to yourself, 'Enery Wilks!" 'e ses.</p>

<p>I didn't answer 'im, remembering 'ow 'is 'uge
progecting ears was tingling, but I ses to meself,
"So much, 'Enery Wilks, for yumin gratitood!"

<p>A little success at golf, as I've notised,
jenerally makes a man wish for more. Like the
appertite of a young girl for chocerlates. I dunno
if you remember that nice old Mister Giggington,
of 'oom I told you. Under my skillfull gidance,
and with the ade of a little inercent 'anky-panky,
'e kontrived to wander rarnd these 'ere links in an
'undred and twenty-nine. Well, ever since that
serprising triemph, 'e 'as been 'ungering for fresh
feelds to konker, as you might say.</p>

<p>"I want to meet someone, 'Enery, as I can
beat," 'e kep' saying, quite truckewlent like. "I
don't pretend as 'ow I'm brillyent, but on my day
I do fancy that there's wuss."</p>

<p>"You keep on practising steddy, sir," was my
invariable words, "and one of these days we shall
see you winning cups and medils."</p>

<p>As nice and kind an old jentleman as ever
smashed a club is Mister Giggington, but I allus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
'ave to 'andle 'im like eggs to prevent 'im losing
'art. I didn't think as 'ow even 'Enery Wilks
would be able to grattify 'is 'armless ambishun,
but the uther day I saw my chawnce.</p>

<p>It was a Toosday morning, and the course was
quite disserted, excep' for Mister G., 'oo was waiting
to start a practice rarnd wiv 'is pashunt teecher.
Which is me. And then a new member come
along 'oo was wishfull for a game, and dirrectly I
set eyes on 'im, somethink, hinstink, I suppose,
seemed to tell me that 'ere was the man for 'oom
I 'ad been waiting.</p>

<p>'E was French, and I shall not attempt to rite
'is name, the 'ang of which I never reely kawt. 'E
was a small, darkish, jornty man, and 'is garmints
was a little briter and more cheerfull-looking than
you see in England. 'E wore, among uther
things, a deer-storker 'at wiv a fevver stuck in it.
But 'is manners was reelly bewtifull. It was quite
a site to see 'im click 'is 'eels togevver, and bow
to my himployer, and in a minute they 'ad fixed
their match. I 'ad 'inted to Mister G. that 'e
must hinsist on 'aving a stroke an 'ole, and that
was 'ow they settled it. I never lerned what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Frenchman's 'andicap was, but if the Champyon
'isself 'ad offered to take strokes from 'im 'e would
'ave closed gladly wiv the offer. And yet there
was reelly nuthing erfensive about the little man.</p>

<p>I could see as 'ow pore old Mister G. was
trimbling wiv a sort of serpressed egsitement, and
I wispered to 'im that 'e must play steddy and use
the niblick whenever possibul. The niblick, from
long practice in the bunkers, is 'is club.</p>

<p>Me frend, Chawley Martin, was the Frenchman's
caddie, and 'e took ercasion to remmark to
me that we seemed in for somethink warmish. I
checked the boy wiv one of my glawnces, and
then we waited while 'is hemployer took the
'onner. That jentleman danced up to the tee,
waving rarnd 'is head the longest and the bendiest
driver that I 'ave ever seen, and 'e didn't trubble
to address the ball at all. 'E just sprung at it and
'it it wiv all 'is might, and somethink fairly wistled
past Chawley's 'ead as 'e stood a little be'ind the
tee box. The Frenchman 'ad sliced at rite angels,
and for anythink I know 'is ball is still in the air.
Certingly, we never saw it agin.</p>

<p>That slite misforchune appeered to egsite and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
dimmoralise Chawley's himployer, 'oo may 'ave
been quite a brillyent player on 'is day, and I may
say at once that 'e never reelly found 'is game.
On the uther 'and it seemed to put new life
and vigger into Mister G. Our erponent was
appariently trying 'ard to do each 'ole in a
brillyent one, but we was quite content to win
them in a steddy nine.</p>

<p>We 'ad our misforchunes, of course. 'Is deerest
frend wouldn't 'ardly say as 'ow Mister G.'s
game is a long one, and each bunker seems to 'ave
a sort of magnettick attrackshun for 'is ball, but
whilst the Frenchman's brassey remained unbroken
we knew that there was allus a chawnce
for the 'ole. For 'arf the rarnd it stood the crewel
strane and then it didn't break. It jest seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62a" id="Page_62a">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sort of dissolve into small peaces. But we was two
up by then and our tails was 'igh in air.</p>

<p>As for the Frenchman, 'is meffods at times was
reelly serprising. After that first drive Chawley
lade 'isself down flat when 'is hemployer drove,
but even in that posishun it didn't seem 'ardly
safe. That long, thin, bendy driver sent the ball
to all 'ites and all angels, but never once in a
strate line. After a wile 'e diskarded it, and guv a
fair, 'onnest trial to every club in 'is bag in turn.
I should never 'ave been serprised to see 'im drive
desperit like wiv 'is putter, but even then Chawley
wouldn't 'ave dared say nuthink. 'E was quite a
plessant, jentlemanly little man, but it didn't do to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64a" id="Page_64a">[Pg 64]</a></span>
argue wiv 'im. 'E begun to scream and stamp at
once, and Chawley saw pretty soon that it was
best and safest to let 'im play 'is own game.</p>

<p>It was on the fiftienth green that the great match
was ended. Mister Giggington's pluck and stamminer
'ad been amasing for 'is age, but the strane
and the joyfull egsitement was beginning to tell on
'im. The Frenchman tried to bring off a thirty-yard
putt to save the 'ole, and failed by some forty
yards. But 'e took 'is defeet like a nero. They
shook 'ands on the green and 'e said that it
warmed 'is 'art to reflect on the glory that 'is
frendly foe 'ad won. I beleeve as 'ow there was
tears in the old jentleman's eyes. 'E turned to
me and I quite thort 'e was going to grasp my
'and, but instead of that 'e put a bob into it
which was pretty near as good.</p>

<p>'E 'll never make a golfer, but 'Enery Wilks
will allus be pleesed and proud to gide 'im rarnd
the course.

<p>'Onnesty is the best pollicy, and, 'Evin knows,
'Enery Wilks 'as allus tried 'is levil best to live up
to them golden words. But I reckon there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
certain excepshuns to the cast-iron 'onnesty of all
of us, and every yumin being 'as 'is little weakness.
Mine is golf balls.</p>

<p>Tips is well enuff in their way, and I 'ave
nuthing at all to say agin them, but the present
of a good ball is far more pleesing to the 'art of
'Enery Wilks. Praps it's becos of 'is allmost
inkonquerabul pride which shrinks at times from
taking munney from them 'oom 'e feels to be 'is
equils or hinfeeriors; or praps it grattifies 'is
artistick nachure to be given the himplements of
that great sience which 'e onderstands so well.
Any'ow golf balls is my temptashun, and one which
once or twice in the course of my 'onnerabul
kareer I 'ave allowed meself to yeeld to.</p>

<p>Some golfers will ercashunally 'and you tuppence
or an 'arf-used ball, wif a jenial word of
thanks for your attenshuns which is worth more
to a proud nachure than the gift itself. And
there's uthers 'oo never think of doing nuthink of
the sort. Among <i>them</i> is Mister Schwabstein, 'oo
is not French or Scotch, as you might think from
'is name, but German, wiv praps a touch of
Jentile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>'E's a man what catches the eye on the links, it
being 'is constant and hannoying 'abbit to were a
peaked yotting cap, large specks, and a white silk
coat which was once a good deal whiter. An
egsellent sort of person, I dessay, in the 'ome
sircle, but 'ardly what you'd call a brillyent success
upon the links. They say as 'ow 'e 'as more
munney than 'e ritely knows what to do wiv, but I
fancy 'e's made it by never giving any of it away.
'Owever, 'Enery Wilks 'as done 'is best to put that
rite.</p>

<p>Let me diskribe to you a rarnd which 'e played
the uther day wiv Mister 'Erminius Brellett,
our litterry member, 'oo allus seems to go out of
'is way to play wiv kurious people. I 'ave taken
Mister Schwabstein in charge before, but never
'ave I seen 'is pecooliarities so noticeabul as on
that day.</p>

<p>'E took the 'onner, and for about three minutes
'e addressed the ball wiv 'is 'uge, thick, ugly driver,
which 'as always rarsed my perfessional hindignashun.
'E swung at last, quite slow like, but wiv
all 'is great weight and strength piled into it. I
shall never know egsackly what 'e did, becos the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
tees was dry, and for the moment I was 'arf
blinded by the dust. But there was a thud and a
krackling snap, and two things was flying through
the thick, dusty air. Them two missils was the
ball and the 'ead of the driver, and they fell
togevver thirty yards from the tee. 'E said somethink
which I couldn't catch and didn't want to,
and walked rarnd in a slow sircle, smiling to 'isself.
'E's a man 'oo allus smiles. It often seems to me
that it is 'is misforchune.</p>

<p>Then Mister Brellett took one of 'is yusual
springing drives, which 'appened to come off, and
'e won that fust 'ole on 'is head. Mister Schwabstein
kontrived to redooce 'is brassey to fragmints
at the second 'ole; and after that he took out 'is
niblick, and nuthing wouldn't perswade 'im to put
it back. 'E drove wiv that niblick, and 'e played
'is many shots through the green wiv it. And the
way that thick strong niblick eat into the turf was
enuff to brake the 'art of 'Enery Wilks. We moved
slowly forward, leaving be'ind us a line of crewel
deep kassims, which nuthink wouldn't fill up.
And 'is stile of bunker play was equilly distrucktive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is noshun of getting out was to distroy the wall
of the bunker wiv reppeated blows, and then to
force 'is ball throo the rewings. I wouldn't 'ave
belleeved that meer wood and iron could 'ave
done the work that that one German niblick did
wivout turning an 'air.</p>

<p>'E only smiled 'is slow smile when Mister Brellett
or meself venchured a remmonstrance, and 'e
would never pick up 'is ball. 'E persevered wiv
each 'ole until at last 'e 'ad pushed the ball into
the tin, and then 'e would turn and pat my 'ead
wiv 'is large 'and. After the fust time I jenerally
dodged, and once 'e turned and patted Mister
Brellett's 'ead by accerdent. Like most litterry
jents, the latter is rather touchy, and there was
neerly trouble; but some'ow, thanks to Mister
Schwabstein's apparent onconshusness of offense,
it was erverted.</p>

<p>At the thirteenth 'ole Mister Brellett was five
up. Mister Schwabstein put down a new ball, wiv
a sort of groan, and pulled it wiv 'is niblick right
rarnd into the rough. For a long two minnutes
we 'unted 'igh and low, but nowhere could we find
that ball. If I'd seen it I would 'ave handed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
over at once, sich being my boundin dooty. But I
never did see it. There was jest one little place
in that rough where some'ow it didn't seem worth
while looking. We 'ad to erbandon it at last;
and Mister Schwabstein lost the 'ole and the
match.</p>

<p>Later in the day I wandered down on a sort of
ferlorn 'ope to that bit of rough, and kuriously
enuff I walked bang on to that ball. There was
severil courses open to me. I might 'ave 'anded
it over to the orthorities, or I might 'ave kep' it as
a memmentoe of Mister Schwabstein's unfaling
jenerosity and kortesy. But 'Enery Wilks didn't
see 'is way to doing either of them two things.
'E jest disposed of that fine new ball to the very
best hadvantage.

<h3>THE SCIENCE OF GOLF</h3>

<blockquote><p>[A certain make of field-glasses is advertised just now
as "suitable for golf-players, enabling them before striking
to select a favourable spot for the descent of their ball."
There can be little doubt that this brilliant hint will be
further developed, with some such results as those outlined
in the following anticipation.]</p></blockquote>

<p>As I told Jones when he met me at the clubhouse,
it was a year or more since I had last
played, so the chances were that I should be a bit
below form. Besides, I was told that the standard
of play had been so raised&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Raised? I should just think it has!" said
Jones. "Why, a year ago they played mere
skittles&mdash;not what you could properly call golf.
Got your clubs? Come along then. Queer old-fashioned
things they are, too! And you're never
going out without your theodolite?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said with considerable surprise, "the
fact is, I haven't got one. What do you use it
for?"</p>

<p>"Taking levels, of course. And&mdash;bless me,
you've no inflater, or glasses&mdash;not even a wind-gauge!
Shall I borrow some for you?&mdash;Oh, just
as you like, but you won't be able to put up much
of a game without them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>


<p>"Does your caddie take all those things?" I
asked, pointing to the curious assortment of
machinery which Jones had put together.</p>

<p>"My caddies do," he corrected. "No one takes
less than three nowadays. Good; there's only
one couple on the first tee, so we shall get away
in half an hour or so."</p>

<p>"I should hope so!" I remarked. "Do you
mean that it will be half an hour before those
men have played two shots?"</p>

<p>"There or thereabouts. Simkins is a fast
player&mdash;wonderful head for algebra that man has&mdash;so
it may be a shade less. Come and watch
him; then you'll see what golf is!"</p>

<p>And indeed I watched him with much interest.
First he surveyed the country with great care
through a field-glass. Then he squinted along a
theodolite at a distant pole. Next he used a
strange instrument which was, Jones told me,
a wind-gauge, and tapped thoughtfully at a pocket-barometer.
After that he produced paper and
pencil, and was immersed apparently in difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
sums. Finally, he summoned one of his caddies,
who carried a metal cylinder. A golf ball was
connected to this by a piece of india-rubber
tubing, and a slight hissing noise was heard.</p>

<p>"Putting in the hydrogen," explained Jones.
"Everything depends upon getting the right
amount. New idea? Not very; even a year
ago you must have seen pneumatic golf balls&mdash;filled
with compressed air? Well, this is only
an obvious improvement. There, he's going to
drive now."</p>

<p>And this he did, using a club unlike anything I
had seen before. Then he surveyed the putting-green&mdash;about
half a mile away&mdash;through his
glasses, and remarked that it was a fairish shot,
the ball being within three inches of the hole.
His companion, who went through the same
lengthy preliminaries, was less fortunate. In a
tone of considerable disgust he announced that
he had over-driven the hole by four hundred
yards.</p>

<p>"Too much hydrogen," murmured Jones, "or
else he got his formul muddled. Well, we can
start now. Shall I lead the way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>I begged him to do so. He in turn surveyed
the country, consulted instruments, did elaborate
sums, inflated his ball.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, at length settling into his
stance, "now I'll show you."</p>

<p>And then he missed the ball clean.</p>

<p> ... Of course he ought not to have used such
language, and yet it was a sort of relief to find
<i>something</i> about the game which was entirely
unchanged.<br /></p>

<h3>CAPABLE CADDIES</h3>

<p>Rumour has it that a movement is on foot
amongst a certain section of the golfing public to
ensure that for the future all caddies on English
links shall be compelled to furnish satisfactory
proof that they are physically and morally qualified
for the porterage and cleaning of clubs, and
acquainted with the more rudimentary principles
of the game. To this end, it is reported, an
entrance examination paper is in course of preparation,
in which individuals aspiring to official
recognition as caddies will be required to obtain a
percentage of at least eighty marks. The following
questions are said to have been already
drafted:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Write your name, legibly if possible, in the
top right-hand corner of the sheet.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Do not trouble to insert your nickname,
as it is a matter of indifference to the
examiners whether you are locally known
as "Tiger," "Ginger," or "Bill Bailey.")</p></blockquote>

<p>2. State your age. If this is less than six, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
more than seventy-five years, you may omit the
remaining questions and retire at once from the
examination.</p>

<p>3. Are you married or single? Give reasons
for your answer.</p>

<p>4. Illustrate the finer points of distinction
between</p>

<blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) a niblick and a gutty;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) a bye and a bulger.</p></blockquote>

<p>5. Are you a Protectionist or a Total Abstainer?</p>

<p>6. Rewrite the following passage, correcting
anything that may strike you as an error or an
incongruity:&mdash;"In an 18-hole match, X., a scratch
player with a handicap of 20, stood dormy 12 at
the 17th hole, but while half-way through the
final green was unfortunate enough to get badly
bunkered behind the tee-box. Being required to
play 'two more' to his opponent Y., who had
laid himself dead in 6, he only played one of
them, thus holing out in 5, and securing a victory
by the narrow margin of 4 up and 7 to play."</p>

<p>7. Given that the regulation charge for a round
is a shilling, would you consider yourself justified
in attempting to exact an extra half-crown for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
club-cleaning from a player in spectacles, with
a handicap of 27 and a wistful expression?

question.)<br /></p>

<h3>THE GOLF WIDOWS</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>After E.B. Browning</i>)</div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">By the side of the sounding sea;</p>
<p>Do you hear the widows weeping, O my brothers,</p>
<p class="i2">Wedded but a few brief years?</p>
<p>They are writing home complaining to their mothers,</p>
<p class="i2">And their ink's suffused with tears.</p>
<p>The young lads are playing in the meadows,</p>
<p class="i2">The young babes are sleeping in the nest;</p>
<p>The young men are flirting in the shadows,</p>
<p class="i2">The young maids are helping them, with zest.</p>
<p>But the young golf widows, O my brothers,</p>
<p class="i2">Are weeping bitterly,</p>
<p>They are weeping in the playtime of the others,</p>
<p class="i2">While you're swiping from the tee.</p>
<br />
<p>Do you ask their grazing widows in their sorrow</p>
<p class="i2">Why their tears are falling so?</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;yesterday&mdash;to-day again&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">To the links you <span class="smcap">always</span> go!</p>
<p>Your golf 'shop,'" they say, "is very dreary,</p>
<p class="i2">You speak of nothing else from week to week;</p>
<p>A really patient wife will grow a-weary</p>
<p class="i2">Of talk about a concentrated cleek."</p>
<p>Yes, the young golf widows, O my brothers,</p>
<p class="i2">Do you ask them why they weep?</p>
<p>They are longing to be back beside their mothers,</p>
<p class="i2">While you're playing in a sweep.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>And well may the widows weep before you</p>
<p class="i2">When your nightly round is done;</p>
<p>They care nothing for a stymie, or the glory</p>
<p class="i2">Gained by holing out in one.</p>
<p>"How long," they say, "how long in careless fashion</p>
<p class="i2">Will you stand, to drive the Dyke, upon our hearts,</p>
<p>Trample down with naild heel our early passion,</p>
<p class="i2">Turning homeward only when the light departs?</p>
<p>You can hear our lamentations many a mile hence,</p>
<p class="i2">Can you hearken without shame,</p>
<p>When our mourning curseth deeper in the silence</p>
<p class="i2">Than a strong man off his game?"</p>

<h3>SHOULD MARRIED MEN BE ALLOWED TO PLAY GOLF?</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>Extract from a Golfer's Diary</i>)</div>

<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;Played Robinson, who would never
win a match if it wasn't for his wife. Think that
I shall start a links for bachelors only. (Mem.&mdash;Suggest
to the committee that no married man is
allowed to play golf in the mornings or afternoons.)</p>

<p>Hole I. I played perfectly, holing beautiful
long putt. Robinson hopeless. One up.</p>

<p>Hole II. R. bunkered. Entirely his own fault.
Two up.</p>

<p>Hole III. Holed my approach, allowing for
both wind and slope of green; really a grand shot.
Caught sight of Mrs. R. as I walked to the next tee.
Three up.</p>

<p>Hole IV. Thought that I might have to speak
to Mrs. R. at any minute. Missed my drive in
consequence. Disgusting! Two up.</p>

<p>Hole V. R. seemed to be looking for his wife
instead of attending to what I was saying. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
drive lay on a buttercup, and who the deuce can
be expected to play off buttercups? One up.</p>

<p>Hole VI. Stymied R. quite perfectly. He pretended
to think that we were not playing stymies.
We were. Two up.</p>

<p>Hole VII. Saw Mrs. R. looking aimlessly out to
sea. These loafing ladies are enough to put any
man off his game. Why can't they do something?
One up.</p>

<p>Hole VIII. R. may say what he likes, but he
waved to his wife. I was also annoyed by his
stockings, which I should think Mrs. R. knitted.
The sort of useless thing she would do. All square.</p>

<p>Hole IX. Got well away from Mrs. R., and
though my caddy coughed as I was approaching I
laid my ball dead. Beautiful shot. One up at the
turn.</p>

<p>Hole X. Had the hole in my pocket when R.
laid his approach dead. Ridiculous luck. All
square.</p>

<p>Hole XI. Just as I was driving I saw Mrs. R. still
looking at the sea. I complained, but R. took no
notice. At any rate she cost me the hole. One
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102a" id="Page_102a">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Hole XII. Vardon couldn't have played better
than I did, and even R. had to say "Good shot!"
twice. All square.</p>

<p>Hole XIII. As I was putting I had a feeling in
my back that Mrs. R. had arrived at last. Missed
my putt and only halved the hole.</p>

<p>Hole XIV. Couldn't see Mrs. R. anywhere.
Wondered where on earth she had got to, or
whether she was drowned. Of course I lost the
hole. One down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Hole XV. A little dispute, as R. claimed that his
ball&mdash;which was under a wheelbarrow&mdash;was on
ground under repair. Absolutely foolish, and I
told him so. All square.</p>

<p>Hole XVI. Made a perfect drive, approach and
putt. Looked everywhere for Mrs. R. and couldn't
see her. One up.</p>

<p>Hole XVII. Completely put off by wondering
when I should see Mrs. R. Most unfair. Told
my caddy I should report him to the committee.
All square.</p>

<p>Hole XVIII. Saw Mrs. R. on a hill half a mile
away. Got on my nerves. R. said, "Halloa,
there's my wife! I thought she wasn't coming
out this morning." Lost the hole and the match,
and told the secretary that R.'s handicap ought to
be reduced.</p>

<h3>LINES ON THE LINKS</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Hard by the biggest hazard on the course,</p>
<p>Beneath the shelter of a clump of gorse,</p>
<p>Secure from shots from off the heel or toe,</p>
<p>I watch the golfers as they come and go.</p>
<br />
<p>I see the fat financier, whose "dunch"</p>
<p>Suggests too copious draughts of "fizz" at lunch;</p>
<p>While the lean usher, primed with ginger beer,</p>
<p>Surmounts the yawning bunker and lies clear.</p>
<br />
<p>I see a member of the House of Peers</p>
<p>Within an ace of bursting into tears,</p>
<p>When, after six stout niblick shots, his ball</p>
<p>Lies worse than if he had not struck at all.</p>
<br />
<p>But some in silent agony endure</p>
<p>Misfortunes no "recovery" can cure,</p>
<p>While others, even men who stand at plus,</p>
<p>Loudly ejaculate the frequent cuss.</p>
<br />
<p>An aged Anglo-Indian oft I see</p>
<p>Who waggles endlessly upon the tee,</p>
<p>Causing impatience of the fiercest kind</p>
<p>To speedy couples pressing from behind.</p>
<br />
<p>Familiar also is the red-haired Pat</p>
<p>Who plays in rain or shine without a hat,</p>
<p>And who, whenever things are out of joint,</p>
<p>"Sockets" his iron shots to cover point.</p>
<br />
<p>Before ten thirty, also after five,</p>
<p>The links with lady players are alive,</p>
<p>At other seasons, by the rules in force,</p>
<p>Restricted to their own inferior course.</p>
<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>One matron, patient in her way as Job,</p>
<p>I've seen who nine times running missed the globe;</p>
<p>But then her daughter, limber maid, can smite</p>
<p>Close on two hundred yards the bounding Kite.</p>
<br />

<hr class="short" />

<br />
<p>Dusk falls upon the bracken, bents and whins;</p>
<p>The careful green-keeper removes the pins,</p>
<p>To-morrow being Sunday, and the sward</p>
<p>Is freed from gutty and from rubber-cored.</p>
<br />
<p>Homeward unchecked by cries of "Fore!" I stroll,</p>
<p>Revolving many problems in my soul,</p>
<p>And marvelling at the mania which bids</p>
<p>Sexagenarians caracole like kids;</p>
<br />
<p>Which causes grave and reverend signiors</p>
<p>To talk for hours of nothing but their scores,</p>
<p>And worse, when baffled by a little ball,</p>
<p>On the infernal deities to call;</p>
<br />
<p>Which brightens overworked officials' lives;</p>
<p>Which bores to tears their much-enduring wives;</p>
<p>Which fosters the consumption of white port,</p>
<p>And many other drinks, both long and short.</p>
<br />
<p>Who then, in face of functions so diverse,</p>
<p>Will call thee, golf, a blessing or a curse?</p>
<p>Or choose between the Premier's predilection</p>
<p>And Rosebery's deliberate rejection?</p>
<br />
<p>Not mine to judge: I merely watch and note</p>
<p>Thy votaries as they grieve or as they gloat,</p>
<p>Uncertain whether envy or amaze</p>
<p>Or pity most is prompted by the craze.</p>

<h3>THE HOLE CONCERN</h3>


<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Any golf-club where an alteration of the course is in prospect.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Any time, from dawn to dusk.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Characters</span>&mdash;<i>Any number of</i> Members, <i>plus (on this occasion) an</i> Inoffensive Stranger.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>First Member</i> (<i>catching sight of</i> Inoffensive
Stranger). Look here, Nobbs, you're an impartial
judge, we'll have your opinion. What I say is
this. If you take the present 4th hole and make
it the 13th, putting the tee back ten yards behind
the 12th, and carry the lower green fifteen yards
to the right, and play the 2nd, 5th and 16th holes
in reverse order, keeping clear of the ditch outside
the 4th green, you'll bring&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second Member.</i> Oh, that's rubbish. Anybody
with a grain of sense would see that you'd utterly
ruin the course that way. My plan is to take the
first three, the 11th, and the 14th&mdash;you understand,
Nobbs?&mdash;(<i>slowly and emphatically</i>) the first
three, the 11th, and the 14th.</p>

<p><i>Inoffensive Stranger.</i> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second M.</i> (<i>quickly</i>). And leave 'em as they are.
Leave 'em just exactly as they are. Then you do
away with the next, make the 3rd into the 7th,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>I.S.</i> (<i>horribly confused</i>). But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third M.</i> Yes, I know&mdash;you're thinking of the
crossing from the 14th. And you're perfectly
right. Simply fatal, that would be; too dangerous
altogether. What we really want is a 2nd hole,
and my plan would make a splendid one&mdash;really
sporting, and giving these gentlemen who fancy
their play a bit to do.</p>

<p><i>Second M.</i> Don't know about <i>that</i>. Tried that
patent 2nd hole of yours this morning out of
curiosity. Holed it with my third, and might
have done it in two, with a bit of luck.</p>

<p><i>Third M.</i> (<i>whistles expressively</i>). Oh, <i>come</i>!
Splendid player you are, and all that&mdash;handicap's
fifteen, isn't it?&mdash;but there aren't <i>many</i> of us
who would stand here and say calmly that we'd
done a hole of 420 yards in three! <i>Really</i>, you
know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second M.</i> 420 yards? 130, you mean.</p>

<p><i>Third M.</i> (<i>defiantly</i>). 420, if an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second M.</i> But look here, you told me yourself
only yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Third M.</i> (<i>slightly taken aback</i>). Oh, ah, yes. I
understand now. I <i>did</i> think, at one time, of
making the 2nd a short hole. But this is quite a
different idea. Miles better, in fact. It flashed
across me quite suddenly at dinner-time last night.
Sort of inspiration&mdash;kind of thing you can't account
for&mdash;but there it <i>is</i>, you see.</p>

<p><i>Fourth M.</i> Well, what you fellows can argue
about like this beats me altogether. There's only
one <i>possible</i> way of improving the course, and I
showed you the plan of it last week. It won't be
adopted&mdash;not likely. So good, and simple, and
inexpensive that the committee won't look at it.
Couldn't expect anything else. Anyhow (<i>with an
air of unappreciated heroism</i>)&mdash;I've done <i>my</i> best for
the club!</p>

<p>(<i>Sighs heavily, and picks up a newspaper.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fifth M.</i> (<i>brutally</i>). Oh, <i>we</i> know all about that
blessed plan of yours. Now, I'm open to conviction.
Mind you, I don't condemn anybody else's
scheme. All that <i>I</i> say is, that if a man doesn't
see that my plan is the best, he's a dunder-headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
jackass, and that's all about it. What do <i>you</i>
think, Mr. Nobbs?</p>

<p><i>I.S.</i> (<i>rather nervously</i>). Well, really&mdash;I hardly
know&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First M.</i> (<i>compassionately</i>). Ah, it's those whins
below the 17th that are bothering <i>you</i>. But if you
exchange the 8th and the 10th&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second M.</i> (<i>abruptly</i>). Rot!</p>

<p>(<i>The battle continues. The</i> Inoffensive Stranger
<i>stealthily withdraws.</i> (<i>Curtain.</i>))<br /></p>

<h3>GOLF AND GOOD FORM</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>By the Expert Wrinkler</i>)</div>

<p>Is it good form to golf? That is a question I
have been so repeatedly asked of late by correspondents
that I can no longer postpone my
answer. Now to begin with, I fear there is no
doubt that golf is a little on the down grade&mdash;socially.
Golf is no longer the monopoly of the
best set, and I am told that artisans' clubs have
actually been started in certain districts. The
other day, as I was travelling in Lancashire, a
man in the same compartment&mdash;with the most
shockingly ill-cut trousers I ever saw&mdash;said to a
friend, "I like 'Oylake, it's 'ealthy, and it's 'andy
and within 'ail of 'ome." And it turned out that
the chief attraction to him at Hoylake was the golf.
Such an incident as this speaks volumes. But I
always try to see both sides of every question, and
there is unquestionably a great deal to be said in
favour of golf. It was undoubtedly played by
kings in the past, and at the present moment is
patronised by grand dukes, dukes, peers and
premiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<h4>GOLF AND DRESS.</h4>

<p>But the real and abiding attraction of golf is
that it mercifully gives more opportunities to the
dressy man than any other pastime. Football
and cricket reduce everyone to a dead level in
dress, but in golf there is any amount of scope
for individuality in costume. Take the case of
colour alone. The other day at Finsbury Park
station I met a friend on his way home from a
day's golfing, and I noticed that he was sporting
the colours of no fewer than five different clubs.
On his cap was the badge of the Camberwell
Crusaders; his tie proved his membership of the
Bickley Authentics; his blazer was that of the
Tulse Hill Nondescripts; his brass waistcoat
buttons bore the monogram of the Gipsy Hill
Zingari; the roll of his knickerbocker stockings
was embroidered with the crest of the Kilburn
Incogs. The effect of the whole was, if I may be
allowed the word, spicy in the extreme. Of course
it is not everyone who can carry off such a combination,
or who can afford to belong to so many
first-class clubs. But my friend is a very handsome
man, and has a handicap of <i>plus</i> two at Tooting Bec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<h4>KNICKERBOCKERS OR TROUSERS.</h4>

<p>The burning question which divides golfers into
two hostile camps is the choice between knickerbockers
and trousers. Personally I favour the
latter, but it is only right to explain that ever
since I was gaffed in the leg by my friend
Viscount &mdash;&mdash; when out cub-sticking with the
Cottesmore I have never donned knickers again.
To a man with a really well-turned calf and neat
ankles I should say, wear knickerbockers whenever
you get a chance. The late Lord Septimus
Boulger, who had very thick legs, and calves that
seemed to begin just above the ankles, used to
wear knickerbockers because he said it put his
opponent off his play. If I may say so without
offence, he was a real funny chap, though a careless
dresser, and I am told that his father, old Lord
Spalding, has never been the same man since his
death.</p>

<h4>STOCKINGS AND CALVES.</h4>

<p>Another advantage of knickerbockers is the
scope they afford for the display of stylish
stockings. A very good effect is produced by
having a little red tuft, which should appear under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the roll which surmounts the calf. The roll itself,
which should always have a smart pattern, is very
useful in conveying the impression that the calf is
more fully developed than it really is. I noticed
the other day at Hanger Hill that Sir Arlington
Ball was playing in a pair of very full knickers,
almost of the Dutch cut, and that his stockings&mdash;of
a plain brown colour&mdash;had no roll such as I
have described. Then of course Sir Arlington has
an exceptionally well-modelled calf, and when in
addition a man has 30,000 a year he may be
allowed a certain latitude in his dress and his
conduct generally.</p>

<h4>BOOTS AND SHOES.</h4>

<p>The question of footwear at golf is one of
considerable difficulty, but there is a general
feeling in favour of shoes. My friend the
Tooting Bec <i>plusser</i> affects a very showy sort of
shoe with a wide welt and a sort of fringe of
narrow strips of porpoise hide, which fall over the
instep in a miniature cataract. As regards the
rival merits of india rubber studs on the soles and
of nails, I compromise by a judicious mixture of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
both. If a waistcoat be worn it should be of the
brightest possible colour. I saw Lord Dunching
the other day at Wimbledon Park in a charming
waistcoat. The groundwork was a rich spinach
green with discs of Pompeian red, and the buttons
were of brass with his monogram in blue and
white enamel in the centre. As it was a cold day
he wore a mustard-coloured Harris tweed Norfolk
jacket and a sealskin cap. Quite a large crowd
followed him, and I heard afterwards that he had
raised the record for the links to 193.</p>

<h4>QUALIFICATIONS FOR A VALET.</h4>

<p>One thing is certain&mdash;and that is we cannot all
be first-class players. Personally, owing to the
accident I have already referred to, I hardly ever
play at all, but I always make it a point, if I am
going on a visit to any place in the country where
I know there are no golf links, to take a few niblicks
with me. A bag for clubs only costs a few
shillings, and it looks well amongst your other
paraphernalia on a journey. In engaging a valet
again, always remember to ascertain whether he
knows the rules of the "royal and ancient game."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
I shall never forget my humiliation when down at
Lord Springvale's. As I was taking part in a
foursome with the Hon. Agrippa Bramble, Lady
Horace Hilton, and the second Mrs. Bunkeray,
I got stuck in a furze-bush and my man handed
me a putter. I could have cried with vexation.</p>

<h4>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cavendish, Chatsworth.</span>&mdash;As to the treatment
of divots, different methods are recommended by
different authorities. My plan, and I am not aware
of a better, is to put them in my pocket when the
caddie is not looking. When thoroughly dried
they form an excellent peat for burning, or can
be used for bedding out rhododendrons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Nil Desperandum," Beckenham.</span>&mdash;The best
stimulant during match play is a beaten-up egg in
a claret glass of sloe gin. The eggs are best
carried in the pocket of your club-bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Flubb, Woking.</span>&mdash;No, it is not good form
to pay your caddie in stamps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcibiades, Wembley Park.</span>&mdash;If you must
play golf on Sunday, I call it nothing short of
hypocritical to go down to the links in a tall hat.</p>

<h3>A LESSON IN GOLF</h3>

<p>"You won't dare!" said I.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else for it," said Amanda
sternly. "You know perfectly well that we must
practise every minute of the time, if we expect to
have the least chance of winning. If she <i>will</i>
come just now&mdash;well!" Amanda cocked her
pretty chin in the air, and looked defiant.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;<i>Aunt Susannah!</i>" said I.</p>

<p>"It's quite time for you to go and meet her,"
said Amanda, cutting short my remonstrances;
and she rose with an air of finality.</p>

<p>My wife, within her limitations, is a very clever
woman. She is prompt: she is resolute: she has
the utmost confidence in her own generalship.
Yet, looking at Aunt Susannah, as she sat&mdash;gaunt,
upright, and formidable&mdash;beside me in the dogcart,
I did not believe even Amanda capable of the
stupendous task which she had undertaken. She
would never dare&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I misjudged her. Aunt Susannah had barely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
sat down&mdash;was, in fact, only just embarking on her
first scone&mdash;when Amanda rushed incontinently in
where I, for one, should have feared to tread.</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Susannah," she said, beaming
hospitably, "I'm sure you will never guess how
we mean to amuse you while you are here!"</p>

<p>"Nothing very formidable, I hope?" said Aunt
Susannah grimly.</p>

<p>"You'll never, never guess!" said Amanda;
and her manner was so unnaturally sprightly that
I knew she was inwardly quaking. "We want to
teach you&mdash;what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think that I'm a trifle old to learn anything
new, my dear," said Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p>I should have been stricken dumb by such a
snub. Not so, however, my courageous wife.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;golf!" she cried, with overdone cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Aunt Susannah started. Recovering herself,
she eyed us with a stony glare which froze me
where I sat.</p>

<p>"There is really nothing else to do in these
wilds, you know," Amanda pursued gallantly,
though even she was beginning to look frightened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"And it is such a lovely game. You'll like it
immensely."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> do you say it is called?" asked Aunt
Susannah in awful tones.</p>

<p>"Golf," Amanda repeated meekly; and for the first time her voice shook.</p>

<p>"Spell it!" commanded Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p>Amanda obeyed, with increasing meekness.</p>

<p>"Why do you call it 'goff' if there's an 'l'
in it?" asked Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid I don't know," said Amanda
faintly.</p>

<p>Aunt Susannah sniffed disparagingly. She condescended,
however, to inquire into the nature of
the game, and Amanda gave an elaborate explanation
in faltering accents. She glanced imploringly
at me; but I would not meet her eye.</p>

<p>"Then you just try to get a little ball into a
little hole?" inquired my relative.</p>

<p>"And in the fewest possible strokes," Amanda
reminded her, gasping.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;is that all?" asked Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes," said Amanda.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>A game described in cold blood sounds singularly
insignificant. We both fell into sudden silence
and depression.</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't sound <i>difficult</i>" said Aunt
Susannah. "Oh, yes, I'll come and play at ball
with you if you like, my dears."</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> Auntie!" said Amanda affectionately.
She did not seem so much overjoyed at her
success, however, as might have been expected.
As for me, I saw a whole sea of breakers ahead;
but then I had seen them all the time.</p>

<p>We drove out to the Links next day. We were
both very silent. Aunt Susannah, however, was
in good spirits, and deeply interested in our clubs.</p>

<p>"What in the world do you want so many sticks
for, child?" she inquired of Amanda.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are for&mdash;for different sorts of ground,"
Amanda explained feebly; and she cast an agonised
glance at our driver, who had obviously overheard,
and was chuckling in an offensive manner.</p>

<p>We both looked hastily and furtively round us
when we arrived. We were early, however, and
fortune was kind to us; there was no one else there.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to watch us a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
first, just to see how the game goes?" Amanda
suggested sweetly.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" was Aunt Susannah's brisk
rejoinder. "I've come here to play, not to look
on. Which stick&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"<i>Club</i>&mdash;they are called clubs," said Amanda.</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired Aunt Susannah.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," faltered Amanda. "Do
you Laurence?"</p>

<p>I did not know, and said so.</p>

<p>"Then I shall certainly call them sticks," said
Aunt Susannah decisively. "They are not in the
least like clubs."</p>

<p>"Shall I drive off?" I inquired desperately of
Amanda.</p>

<p>"Drive off? Where to? Why are you going
away?" asked Aunt Susannah. "Besides, you
can't go&mdash;the carriage is out of sight."</p>

<p>"The way you begin is called driving off," I
explained laboriously. "Like this." I drove
nervously, because I felt her eye upon me. The
ball went some dozen yards.</p>

<p>"That seems easy enough," said Aunt
Susannah. "Give me a stick, child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that end&mdash;the <i>other</i> end!" cried Amanda,
as our relative prepared to make her stroke with
the butt-end.</p>

<p>"Dear me! Isn't that the handle?" she
remarked cheerfully; and she reversed her club,
swung it, and chopped a large piece out of the
links. "Where is it gone? Where is it gone?"
she exclaimed, looking wildly round.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it isn't gone," said Amanda nervously,
and pointed to the ball still lying at her feet.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary thing!" cried Aunt
Susannah; and she made another attempt, with
a precisely similar result. "Give me another
stick!" she demanded. "Here, let me choose
for myself&mdash;this one doesn't suit me. I'll have
that flat thing."</p>

<p>"But that's a putter," Amanda explained
agonisedly.</p>

<p>"What's a putter? You said just now that
they were all clubs," said Aunt Susannah, pausing.</p>

<p>"They are all clubs," I explained patiently.
"But each has a different name."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you give them names
like a little girl with her dolls?" cried Aunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157a" id="Page_157a">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Susannah. "Why, what a babyish game it is!"
She laughed very heartily. "At any rate," she
continued, with that determination which some of
her friends call by another name, "I am sure
that this will be easier to play with!" She
grasped the putter, and in some miraculous way
drove the ball to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>"Oh, splendid!" cried Amanda. Her troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
brow cleared a little, and she followed suit, with
mediocre success. Aunt Susannah pointed out
that her ball had gone farther than either of ours,
and grasped her putter tenaciously.</p>

<p>"It's a better game than I expected from your
description," she conceded. "Oh, I daresay I
shall get to like it. I must come and practise
every day." We glanced at each other in a silent
horror of despair, and Aunt Susannah after a few
quite decent strokes, triumphantly holed out.
"What next?" said she.</p>

<p>I hastily arranged her ball on the second tee:
but the luck of golf is proverbially capricious.
She swung her club, and hit nothing. She swung
it again, and hit the ground.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> can't I do it?" she demanded, turning
fiercely upon me.</p>

<p>"You keep losing your feet," I explained
deferentially.</p>

<p>"Spare me your detestable slang terms,
Laurence, at least!" she cried, turning on me
again like a whirlwind. "If you think I have
lost my temper&mdash;which is absurd!&mdash;you might
have the courage to say so in plain English!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, Aunt Susannah!" I said. "You
don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or want to," she snapped. "Of all silly
games&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean you misunderstood me," I pursued,
trembling. "Your foot slipped, and that spoilt
your stroke. You should have nails in your boots,
as we have."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Aunt Susannah, only half pacified.
But she succeeded in dislodging her ball at last,
and driving it into a bunker. At the same
moment, Amanda suddenly clutched me by the
arm. "Oh, Laurence!" she said in a bloodcurdling
whisper. "<i>What</i> shall we do? Here
is Colonel Bartlemy!"</p>

<p>The worst had happened. The hottest-tempered
man in the club, the oldest member, the best
player, the greatest stickler for etiquette, was hard
upon our track; and Aunt Susannah, with a red
and determined countenance, was urging her
ball up the bunker, and watching it roll back
again.</p>

<p>"Dear Auntie," said Amanda, in her sweetest
voice, "you had much better take it out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that allowed?" inquired our relative
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you may always do that and lose a
stroke!" I assured her eagerly.</p>

<p>"I shan't dream of losing a stroke!" said Aunt
Susannah, with decision. "I'll get it out of this
ditch by fair means, if I have to spend all day
over it!"</p>

<p>"Then do you mind waiting one moment?" I
said, with the calmness of despair. "There is a
player behind us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him stay behind us! I was here first,"
said Aunt Susannah; and she returned to her
bunker.</p>

<p>The Links rose up in a hillock immediately
behind us, so that our successor could not see us
until he had reached the first hole. I stood with
my eye glued to the spot where he might be
expected to appear. I saw, as in a nightmare, the
scathing remarks that would find their way into
the Suggestion Book. I longed for a sudden and
easy death.</p>

<p>At the moment when Colonel Bartlemy's
rubicund face appeared over the horizon, Aunt
Susannah, flushed but unconquered, drew herself
up for a moment's rest from toil. He had seen
her. Amanda shut her eyes. For myself, I
would have run away shamelessly, if there had
been any place to run to. The Colonel and Aunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Susannah looked hard at each other. Then he
began to hurry down the slope, while she started
briskly up it.</p>

<p>"Miss Cadwalader!" said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Colonel Bartlemy!" cried Aunt Susannah;
and they met with effusion.</p>

<p>I saw Amanda's eyes open, and grow round
with amazed interest. I knew perfectly well that
she had scented a bygone love affair, and was
already planning the most suitable wedding-garb
for Aunt Susannah. A frantic hope came to me
that in that case the Colonel's affection might
prove stronger than his zeal for golf. They were
strolling down to us in a leisurely manner, and
the subject of their conversation broke upon my
astonished ears.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you don't think much of these
Links, after yours," Colonel Bartlemy was saying
anxiously. "They are rather new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I've played on many worse," said Aunt
Susannah, looking round her with a critical eye.
"Let me see&mdash;I haven't seen you since your
victory at Craigmory. Congratulations!"</p>

<p>"Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley!"
purred the Colonel, evidently much gratified.
"You will be here for the twenty-seventh, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Exactly what I came for," said Aunt
Susannah calmly.</p>

<p>"Though I don't know what our ladies will say
to playing against the Cranford Champion!"
chuckled the Colonel; and then they condescended
to become aware of our existence. We
had never known before how exceedingly small it
is possible to feel.</p>

<p>"Aunt Susannah, what am I to say? What
fools you must think us!" I murmured miserably
to her, when the Colonel was out of earshot looking
for his ball. "We are such raw players ourselves&mdash;and
of course we never dreamt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Susannah twinkled at me in a friendly
manner. "There's an ancient proverb about eggs
and grandmothers," she remarked cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>


<p>"There should be a modern form for golf-balls
and aunts&mdash;hey, Laurence?"</p>

<p>Amanda did not win the prize brooch; but
Aunt Susannah did, in spite of an overwhelming
handicap, and gave it to her. She does not often
wear it&mdash;possibly because rubies are not becoming
to her: possibly because its associations are too
painful.<br /></p>

<p>'Tis a brilliant autumn day,</p>
<p>And the breeze has blown away</p>
<p>All the clouds that lowered gray;</p>
<p class="i12">So methinks,</p>
<p>As I've half an hour to spare,</p>
<p>I will go and take the air,</p>
<p>While the weather still is fair,</p>
<p class="i12">On the Links.</p>
<br />
<p>I admire the splendid view,</p>
<p>The delicious azure hue</p>
<p>Of the ocean and&mdash;when, <i>whew</i>!</p>
<p class="i12">With a crack,</p>
<p>Lo! there drops a little ball</p>
<p>Which elects to break its fall</p>
<p>By alighting on the small</p>
<p class="i12">Of my back.</p>
<br />
<p>In the distance someone cries</p>
<p>Some remark about my eyes,</p>
<p>None too pleasant, I surmise,</p>
<p class="i12">From the tone;</p>
<p>So away my steps I turn</p>
<p>Till a figure I discern,</p>
<p>Who is mouching by the burn</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>They told me he was skilful, and assiduous, and true,</p>
<p class="i4">They told me he had "carried" for the bravest and the best.</p>
<p>His hair was soldier-scarlet, and his eyes were saucer blue,</p>
<p class="i4">And one seemed looking eastward, whilst the other fronted west.</p>
<p>His strabismus was a startler, and it shook my nerve at once;</p>
<p class="i4">It affected me with dizziness, like gazing from a height.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<p>I straddled like a duffer, and I wavered like a dunce,</p>
<p class="i4">And my right hand felt a left one, and my left felt far from right.</p>
<p>As I watched him place my ball with his visual axes crossed,</p>
<p class="i4">The very sunshine glimmered, with a queer confusing glint,</p>
<p>I felt like a sick lubber on Atlantic surges tossed&mdash;</p>
<p class="i8">Oh! never have a caddie with a squint!</p>
<br />
<p>I'm an "irritable duffer"&mdash;so my enemies declare,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">That is I'm very sensitive, and play a modest game.</p>
<p>A very little puts me off my stroke, and, standing there,</p>
<p class="i4">With his boot-heels at right angles, and his optics much the same,</p>
<p>He maddened me&mdash;no less, and I felt that all success</p>
<p class="i4">Against bumptious young McBungo&mdash;was impossible that day.</p>
<p>I'd have parted with a fiver to have beaten him. His dress</p>
<p class="i4">Was so very very swagger, and his scarlet cap so gay.</p>
<p>He eyed my cross-eyed caddie with a supercilious smirk,</p>
<p class="i4">I tried to set my features, and my nerves, like any flint;</p>
<p>But my "knicker'd" knees were knocking as I wildly set to work.</p>

<p class="i4">But for fiendish fascination he was like a squinting snake;</p>
<p>All the muffings man can muff I contrived to muff that day;</p>
<p class="i4">My eyes were all askew and my nerves were all ashake.</p>
<p>I seemed to squint myself, and not only with my eyes,</p>
<p class="i4">My knees, my hands, my elbows, with obliquity were rife.</p>
<p>McBungo's sleek sham sympathy and sinister surprise</p>
<p class="i4">Made almost insupportable the burden of my life.</p>
<p>He <i>was</i> so beastly friendly, and he <i>was</i> so blazing fair,</p>
<p class="i4">So fulsomely effusive with suggestion, tip, and hint!</p>
<p>And all the while that caddie stood serenely cock-eyed there.</p>
<p class="i8">Oh! <i>never</i> have a caddie with a squint!</p>
<br />
<p>Miss Binks was looking on! On that maiden I was gone,</p>
<p class="i4">Just as she was gone on golf, in perfervid Scottish style.</p>
<p>On my merits with McBungo I should just about have won,</p>
<p class="i4">But my shots to-day were such as made even Effie smile;</p>
<p>Oh, the lumps of turf I lifted! Oh, the easy balls I missed!</p>
<p class="i4">Oh, the bunkers I got bogged in! And at last a gentle scorn</p>
<p>Curled the lips I would have given my pet "Putter" to have kissed.</p>
<p class="i4">Such a bungler as myself her loved links had never borne;</p>
<p>And all the while McBungo&mdash;the young crocodile!&mdash;bewailed</p>
<p class="i4">What he called my "beastly luck," though his joy was plain as print,</p>
<p>Whilst that squint grew worse and worse at each shot of mine which failed.</p>

<p>In "playing through the green" with my "brassie" I was seen</p>
<p class="i4">At most dismal disadvantage on that miserable day;</p>
<p><i>He</i> pointed through the rushes with cock-eyed, sardonic spleen,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">I followed his squint guidance, and I struck a yard away;</p>
<p>But, oh! 'twas worst of all, when I tried to hole the ball.</p>
<p class="i4">Oh, the ogre! <i>How</i> he squinted at that crisis of the game!</p>
<p>His hideous strabismus held me helpless, a blind thrall</p>
<p class="i4">Shattered my nerves completely, put my skill to open shame.</p>
<p>That squint would, I am sure, have upset the solar system&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<p class="i4">Oho! the impish impudence, the gruesome goggle-glint!</p>
<p>The low, malicious chuckle, as he softly muttered, "Missed 'im!"</p>
<p class="i8">No, <i>never</i> have a caddie with a squint!</p>
<br />
<p>Yet all the same McBungo did <i>not</i> get that rich Miss Binks,</p>
<p class="i4">Who was so sweet in every way, especially on golf.</p>
<p>He fancied he had cut me out that day upon those links,</p>
<p class="i4">But although he won the game&mdash;at golf, his love-game came not off.</p>
<p>He and that demon caddie tried between them very hard</p>
<p class="i4">To shame me in the eyes of that dear enthusiast,</p>
<p>But&mdash;well, my clubs she carries, whilst McBungo, evil-starred,</p>
<p class="i4">Was caught by a Scotch vixen with an obvious optic cast!</p>
<p><i>That's</i> Nemesis, I say! And she will not let him play</p>
<p class="i4">At the game he so adores. True she's wealthy as the Mint.</p>
<p>At golf, with Effie, I have passed many a happy day,</p>
<p class="i8">But&mdash;we never have a caddie with a squint!</p>
<br />
<p>A caddie who's a duffer, or a caddie who gets drunk;</p>
<p class="i4">A caddie who regards all other caddies as his foes;</p>
<p>A caddie who will snigger when you fumble, fail or funk;</p>
<p class="i4">A caddie who will whistle, or seems ever on the doze;</p>
<p>A caddie who's too tiny, or too big and broad of bulk;</p>
<p class="i4">A caddie who gets playing with your clubs upon the sly;</p>
<p>A caddie who will chatter, or a caddie who will sulk;</p>
<p class="i4">All these are calculated a golf devotee to try;</p>
<p>All these are most vexatious to a golfer of repute;</p>
<p class="i4">And still more so to a novice. But just take a friendly hint!</p>
<p>Take a caddie who's a duffer, or a drunkard, or a brute,</p>

<p>And his face has a look that is weary and sad,</p>

<p>Where it's quite on the cards that they may play with papa,</p>
<p>And where all that goes on is surveyed by mamma,</p>
<br />
<p>To golf on the downs for the whole of the day</p>
<p class="i4">Is "so awfully jolly," they keep on asserting,</p>
<p>With a good-looking fellow to teach you the way,</p>
<p class="i4">And to fill up the time with some innocent flirting,</p>
<p>And it may be the maiden is woo'd and is won,</p>
<p>Ere the whole of the round is completed and done.</p>
<br />
<p>Henceforward, then, golf is the game for the fair&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">At home, and abroad, or in pastures colonial,</p>
<p>And the shouts of the ladies will quite fill the air</p>

<p>And for husbands our daughters in future will seek</p>
<p>With the powerful aid of the putter and cleek!</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
